# Cheersly-App

My husband and I do this thing when we travel where we’re always on the hunt for the best espresso martini. Even in the city where we live, we’re always on the hunt. Then we thought, well there’s probably other people that do this too, maybe an espresso martini isn’t what they hunt for, maybe it’s something else. That’s where the idea of this app came from.

However, it’s not just the taste that makes the drink. It’s the atmosphere of the establishment, the company around you,  the presentation of the drink, etc. So why not take all of that and compile it together so that you can find the best drink out there.

Cheersly is an app that lets you review certain drinks based off taste, presentation, restaurant atmosphere, etc. So that wherever you are, you can find the best of any particular drink that you’re looking for.
